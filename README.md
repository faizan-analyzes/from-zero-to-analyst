# Hi, I'm Faizan – Aspiring Data Analyst

Welcome to my Daily learning journey in data analytics!  
Each day, I’ll share what I’ve learned, practiced, and built as I move closer to my goal of becoming a skilled Data Analyst. 💻📊

---

## 🎯 My Goal
To become a job-ready Data Analyst with strong foundations in:
- Python & SQL
- Data Cleaning & Analysis
- Data Visualization (Tableau, Power BI)
- Tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Real-world projects and insights

---


# 🚀 SQL Learning Journey (Microsoft SQL Server + SSMS)
---

## 📅 Day 1 – Getting Started

**What I learned:**
- Installed **Microsoft SQL Server** and **SSMS**
- Understood the difference between SQL Server Configuration Manager and SSMS
- Connected to the database engine and created my first database
- Practiced basic SQL commands:
  - `CREATE`
  - `INSERT`
  - `SELECT`
  - `DISTINCT`

> 💡 First day diving into database world — learned how to interact with SQL Server and execute basic queries.

---

## 📅 Day 2 – Filtering & Organizing Data

**What I learned:**
- Filtering data using:
  - `WHERE`
  - `BETWEEN`
  - `IN`
- Logical operators:
  - `AND`
  - `OR`
  - `NOT`
- Sorting data using:
  - `ORDER BY ASC`
  - `ORDER BY DESC`
- Continued practicing `INSERT` with more complex inputs

> 📊 Learned how to extract meaningful results by filtering, combining conditions, and sorting data efficiently.

---

## 📅 Day 3 – Data Modification & Table Management

**What I learned:**
- Modifying data with:
  - `UPDATE`
  - `DELETE`
- Managing tables with:
  - `TRUNCATE`
  - `DROP`
- Aggregation function:
  - `MAX()` – finding highest values in a column

> ⚠️ Gained confidence in modifying and managing data while understanding the importance of using these commands carefully to avoid data loss.

---

## 📅 Day 4 – Aggregation & Grouping

**What I learned:**
- Aggregate functions for summarizing data:
  - `MIN()`
  - `SUM()`
  - `AVG()`
  - `COUNT()`
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY`
- Filtering grouped results using `HAVING`
- Understood the key **difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`**:
  - `WHERE` filters rows **before** grouping
  - `HAVING` filters groups **after** aggregation
- Practiced multiple examples to strengthen understanding 💪

---

## 📅 Day 5 – Mastering SQL Joins

**What I learned:**
- Explored different types of **SQL Joins** to combine data from multiple tables:
  - `INNER JOIN` – shows only matching records from both tables
  - `LEFT JOIN` – shows all records from the left table + matched records from the right
  - `RIGHT JOIN` – shows all records from the right table + matched records from the left
- Practiced real-world join scenarios like:
  - Employees and their departments
  - Customers and their orders
  - Handling NULL values in join results
- Learned how each join behaves with missing or unmatched data

🧠 Understanding joins has opened up powerful ways to work with **relational data** — this is a must-have skill for any Data Analyst!

---

## 📅 Day 6 – Advanced Joins & Pattern Matching

**What I learned:**

🔹 Explored **advanced join techniques**:
- `LEFT ANTI JOIN` – retrieves rows from the left table **not** present in the right table
- `RIGHT ANTI JOIN` – retrieves rows from the right table **not** present in the left table
- `SELF JOIN` – used to join a table to itself (e.g., comparing employees with managers)

🔹 Learned the use of:
- `UNION` – combines result sets from two queries (removes duplicates)
- `UNION ALL` – similar to `UNION` but **keeps duplicates**

🔹 Deep-dived into **pattern matching** using the `LIKE` operator:
- `%` – wildcard for any number of characters
- `_` – wildcard for a single character

🔍 Solved real-world examples with `LIKE`, such as:
- Finding names starting with 'A'
- Emails containing specific domains
- Filtering records based on string patterns

---

## 📅 Day 7 – Nested CASE, Constraints & Query Execution Order

**What I learned today:**

🔸 **Nested CASE Statement**  
- Learned how to use `CASE` inside another `CASE` to handle complex conditions  
- Great for assigning categories, flags, or labels based on multiple logic branches  

🔸 **SQL Constraints**

NOT NULL – ensures a column cannot have NULL values

UNIQUE – ensures all values are different

PRIMARY KEY – uniquely identifies each row

FOREIGN KEY – links to a primary key in another table

CHECK – enforces a condition

DEFAULT – sets a default value for a column

🔸 **SQL Query Execution Order (Behind the Scenes)**
Understanding the logical processing order of SQL statements:

FROM

JOIN

WHERE

GROUP BY

HAVING

SELECT

ORDER BY

This helped me write better-optimized and logically structured queries. 🧠

---

📅 **Day 8: Strengthening SQL with 20 Practice Examples**
Today I dedicated my time to solving 20 SQL examples that covered various concepts I've learned so far. This practice helped me:

✅ Strengthen my understanding of SQL queries
✅ Apply real-world logic to filtering, joining, and aggregating data
✅ Boost my confidence with structured problem-solving in SQL

Topics reinforced through examples:

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING

Aggregate functions like MAX, SUM, COUNT, AVG

Pattern matching using LIKE

📝 Solving practical problems is the best way to sharpen your SQL mindset — and that’s exactly what today was all about!
